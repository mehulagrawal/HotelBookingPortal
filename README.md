# HotelBookingPortal
This hotel booking portal was made by Mehul Agrawal, Abhishek Dhanwani and Vishakh Shah. This project was done in their second year. It's a java based program which uses a SQL Database. The front-end of the software is made using Swing. 

The Database files are kept in "hbsmav" folder which contains tree .ibd files which represent the three tables. The main executable file is kept in the "dist" folder with the name of MAV.jar.

For the program to work correctly on your computer, you need to have the latest version of Java and the corresponding JDBC driver. You will also need to change the path of the databse and the JDBC driver wherever they are mentioned in the code.
